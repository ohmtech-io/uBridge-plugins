## uBridge

**uBridge** is a lightweight, free __Open Source__, modular C++ service that detects and manages _uThing_ devices, streams their measurements over NNG PUB/SUB, and exposes control and status via NNG REQ/REP. Itâ€™s designed to run very efficiently on Linux gateways and SBCs.

The system consists of a main service (`ubridge`) which manages connected uThing devices and publishes data to clients (`plugin` applications that can run on the same host or remotely).
